## CREATE CHROMA DB DATABASE (RUN THIS ONLY ONCE AND IT WILL SAVE THE DATABASE)

```
python build_database.py
```

And currently, we are changing the user request in the `user_request.txt` file. 

```
python main.py -u "user_request.txt"
```
Or you can use the chat playground

```
streamlit run streamlit.py
```
