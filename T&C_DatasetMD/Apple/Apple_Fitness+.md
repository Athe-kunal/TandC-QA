- When you explore Fitness+ prior to subscribing, Apple collects information about your browsing activity, including the workout previews you watch, and about any marketing campaign that led you to the app. This information is associated with your Apple ID and is used to improve the service.
- If you subscribe, we use information about your subscription status, tied to your Apple ID, to provide you the service, send you marketing communications, and to ensure that ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks, where available, are relevant to you. Data about your use of the Fitness+ service is stored against a random identifier that is specific to Fitness+ and not associated with your Apple ID.
- If you enable Activity Sharing in the Fitness app, your Fitness+ Workout and Activity data will be shared with friends, and will be sent to Apple and retained for a short period of time so that Apple can securely share this data with whomever you choose. This data may include: active calories or kilojoules, exercise minutes, stand or roll hours, steps, time zone, and workout information such as title, type, and duration.

Apple Fitness+ is a fitness service powered by Apple Watch. You can choose from a catalog of workouts and meditations led by expert trainers.

Pre-Subscription

Prior to subscribing to Apple Fitness+, you can explore the service and view workout previews. Apple collects information about your browsing activity in the Fitness+ tab, such as the pages you view and the workout previews you watch, the type of device you are using, and your interactions with notifications. If you enter the Apple Fitness+ tab through a link from a marketing campaign, like an email or digital advertisement, Apple records information about the marketing campaign to provide attribution to the marketing source and to improve our marketing campaigns.

Apple stores this information associated with your Apple ID and uses it to improve Apple Fitness+.

Apple Fitness+ Activity and Workouts

Once you subscribe to Apple Fitness+, Apple may collect information about your browsing activity in Fitness+ in the Fitness, Workout, and Mindfulness apps, such as the pages you view, the features with which you interact, and actions that cause you to enter and exit the app such as following an external link that leads you to Fitness+ or exiting the app through a link to Apple Music. Apple also collects information about the type of device you are using, your interactions with notifications, and your subscription, as well as some demographic information including your gender and age range.

When you do a Fitness+ workout or meditation, Apple collects information about the session and how you interact with it including the session length, your navigation actions such as play and pause, how much of the session you complete, whether the session is audio or video, the language settings, whether you have downloaded or are streaming the session, and whether you are using features like AirPlay or Picture in Picture. Apple will collect your workout or meditation titles and trainers only if you choose to enable Improve Fitness+. If you use SharePlay to do a workout with other users, Apple will collect that you did a workout during a SharePlay session and the number of devices that participated in the session, but will not collect any information to identify the participants of a SharePlay session.

All of this data is stored against a random, rotating identifier that is specific to Apple Fitness+ and not associated with your Apple ID. Apple uses this information to provide and improve the service.

iCloud Syncing

As a convenience for you, Apple Fitness+ uses iCloud to keep aspects of your experience up to date on all of your devices. For example, Fitness+ will use iCloud to sync your progress in a workout or meditation across your devices. You can disable this capability at any time on an iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud, then tapping to turn off Fitness+.

Burn Bar

The Burn Bar allows you to measure your workout performance against other users who have completed the same workout. If you choose to enable the Burn Bar, your Metabolic Equivalent of Task for the workout — your MET value — will be stored by Apple anonymously to add to the Burn Bar for that workout, and will not be associated with your Apple ID or with your other Apple Fitness+ data. You can disable the Burn Bar at any time while completing a workout in the workout settings.

Activity Sharing

If you enable Activity Sharing in the Fitness app, your Fitness+ Workout and Activity data will be shared with friends, and will be sent to Apple so that Apple can securely share this data with whomever you choose. This data may include: active calories or kilojoules, exercise minutes, stand or roll hours, steps, time zone, and workout information such as title, type, and duration. Apple will retain your Workout and Activity data for a short period of time and will use this data only to enable the Activity Sharing feature.

Apple Music

Apple Fitness+ playlists are available in Apple Music. If you tap to listen to a playlist in Apple Music, you will be redirected to that app and any actions you take will be subject to Apple Music & Privacy at [www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-music](http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-music). For example, Apple knows the titles of your playlists, which may reveal the workout you completed, and if you share playlists with friends in Apple Music, your friends will learn that information, as well.

Sharing with Third Parties

We are obligated to provide some non-personal data about what songs are played in Apple Fitness+ to strategic partners associated with this service, such as record labels, so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services.

Communicating with You

All Fitness+ personalized workout recommendations are powered using on-device intelligence so that Apple does not need to store your workout history.

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Apple Fitness+ and other related Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Your device serial number may be used to check eligibility for service offers. If you are in a Family, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you emails and push notifications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed. Apple Fitness+ may send you push notifications about new features, content, and offers available in Apple Fitness+. To update your notification preferences on an iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Fitness.

Advertising

If the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use information about your Fitness+ subscription status, such as whether you subscribe through Apple One, to ensure that ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks are relevant.

If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can turn off Personalized Ads. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you. You can disable Personalized Ads on your iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising, and deselect Personalized Ads.
