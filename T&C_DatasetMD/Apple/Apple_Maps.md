Upon Apple’s request, you agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, contractors, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of your violation of these Terms of Use and/or use of the Service. 

**IX. Controlling Law, Venue, Dispute Resolution and Severability**

These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. These Terms of Use shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If you are a consumer based in the United Kingdom, these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence. 

The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.

**X. Entire Agreement**

These Terms of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and Apple and governs your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements with respect to the same subject matter between you and Apple. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the Service, affiliate services, third-party content, third-party software, or additional services. If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. Apple’s failure to enforce any right or provisions in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such or any other provision. Apple will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.

**XI. Feedback and Information**

Any feedback you provide on the Service shall be deemed to be non-confidential. Apple shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.
