# <a name="_mtfpyy73mj9t"></a>**Piracy Prevention**
Apple actively and aggressively enforces its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law. Apple works closely with the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) to combat software piracy worldwide.
### <a name="_sxvwa63753xs"></a>**Software Piracy**
Software piracy (the illegal copying of software programs) is a worldwide problem — more than $11 billion is lost to piracy every year. Because software is valuable, and it is easy to create an exact copy of a program from a single computer, software piracy is widespread.

The illegal copying of software programs is a crime! In the United States and many other countries, copyright law provides for severe civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted material. Copyrighted material includes, but is not limited to, computer programs and accompanying sounds, images and text. Under U.S. law, infringement may result in civil damages of up to $150,000 and/or criminal penalties of up to five years imprisonment and/or a $250,000 fine.

Please join Apple in its piracy prevention efforts. You can report incidents of software piracy to the SIIA (see below section “Report Piracy to the SIIA.”) Also, you can help your business avoid serious problems with sound software asset management practices as explained in the section below.
### <a name="_qw77fzvtrrat"></a>**Software Asset Management**
It is important to manage software well, just as you would any other valuable company asset, in order to avoid serious problems. Apple aggressively enforces our company’s proprietary rights under the U.S. copyright laws, but we know that poor software asset management often keeps people from complying with the law.
### <a name="_25zutkk2ard0"></a>**Report Piracy to SIIA**
You may report suspected piracy of Apple software to the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA). Visit SIIA’s Web site <http://www.siia.net/Divisions/IP-Protection-Services>. Apple is a member of the SIIA.

# <a name="_7mq73mkligd"></a>**Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy**
Apple and its employees and contractors do not accept, review or consider any unsolicited ideas, works, materials, proposals, suggestions, artwork, content or the like, including for advertising campaigns, promotions, products, services, technologies, product enhancements, processes, marketing strategies, product names, content or creative materials (all of the foregoing “submissions”). Please do not send or provide any submissions in any form to Apple or any of its employees or contractors.

The purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when Apple’s products, services, technologies, advertising, promotions, marketing strategies or content might seem similar to submissions provided to Apple. If, despite our request that you not send us your submissions, you still submit them, then regardless of what your correspondence says, the following terms will apply to your submissions.
### <a name="_ii97fjf1b1up"></a>**Terms of Idea Submission**
You agree that: (1) your submissions and their contents along with related intellectual property rights will automatically become the property of Apple, without any compensation to you; (2) Apple may use or redistribute the submissions and their contents for any purpose and in any way on an unrestricted basis; (3) there is no obligation for Apple to review the submissions; and (4) there is no obligation to keep any submissions confidential.
### <a name="_13c13bga9n0z"></a>**Product Feedback**
Apple does, however, welcome your feedback regarding many areas of Apple’s existing business. If you want to send us feedback, we request that you use the forms located at [www.apple.com/feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback), where you can choose from the many listed areas for your feedback. Please provide only specific feedback on Apple’s existing products, services and marketing strategies using those forms; and do not send or provide any submissions other than using those forms.
### <a name="_dvl85b3lvq2t"></a>**Feedback and Information**
Any feedback you provide at this site will be deemed to be non-confidential and not proprietary. Apple will be free to use and redistribute such information on an unrestricted basis, without any compensation to you.

# <a name="_em7ub4evcwud"></a>**Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights**
(Formerly entitled Guidelines for Third Parties Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights)

These guidelines are for Apple licensees, authorized resellers, developers, customers, and other parties wishing to use Apple’s trademarks, service marks or images in promotional, advertising, instructional, or reference materials, or on their web sites, products, labels, or packaging. Use of the keyboard Apple Logo (Option-Shift-K) for commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Apple may constitute trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of federal and state laws. Use of Apple trademarks may be prohibited, unless expressly authorized.

If you are a licensee of an Apple trademark or logo and have been provided with special trademark usage guidelines with your license agreement, please follow those guidelines. If your license agreement does not provide usage guidelines, then follow these guidelines. If you are an Apple Authorized Reseller or member of an Apple program, you may be subject to additional restrictions.

Apple’s trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are valuable assets. In following these guidelines, you help us protect our valuable trademark rights and strengthen our corporate and brand identities. By using an Apple trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that Apple is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with Apple’s rights in the trademark, including challenging Apple’s use, registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any Apple trademark. The goodwill derived from using any part of an Apple trademark exclusively inures to the benefit of and belongs to Apple. Except for the limited right to use as expressly permitted under these Guidelines, no other rights of any kind are granted hereunder, by implication or otherwise. If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please talk to your Apple representative or submit your query to [Apple’s Trademark Department](https://www.apple.com/legal/contact/).

**Rules for Proper Use of Apple Trademarks**

**2.** As adjectives, trademarks may not be used in the plural or possessive form.

Correct: I bought two Macintosh computers.

Not Correct: I bought two Macintoshes.

**3.** An appropriate generic term must appear after the trademark the first time it appears in a printed piece, and as often as is reasonable after that. For a list of suggested generic terms see the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html).

**4.** Always spell and capitalize Apple’s trademarks exactly as they are shown in the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html). Do not shorten or abbreviate Apple product names. Do not make up names that contain Apple trademarks.

**Proper Trademark Notice and Attribution**

**1. Distribution Within the United States Only**

a. On product, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed only in the United States, use the appropriate trademark symbol (TM, SM, ®) the first time the Apple trademark appears in the text of the advertisement, brochure, or other material.

b. Refer to the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html) for the correct trademark symbol, spelling of the trademark, and generic term to use with the trademark. Generally, the symbol appears at the right shoulder of the trademark (except the Apple Logo, where the logo appears at the right foot).

c. Include an attribution of Apple’s ownership of its trademarks within the credit notice section of your product, product documentation, or other product communication.

Following are the correct formats:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are trademarks of Apple Inc.

**2. Distribution Outside the United States:**

a. Do not use trademark symbols on products, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed outside the United States.

b. Use one of the following international credit notices:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries and regions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a trademark of Apple Inc.

**Depictions of Apple Products**

**1. Endorsement or Sponsorship:** Apple does not support the use of its logos, company names, product names, or images of Apple products by other parties in marketing, promotional or advertising materials as their use may create the perception that Apple endorses or sponsors the product, service or promotion.

**2. Compatibility:** If you are a developer, you may show an image of an Apple product in your promotional/advertising materials to depict that your product is compatible with, or otherwise works with, the Apple product or technology, provided you comply with the following requirements:

b. The image is an actual photograph of the genuine Apple product and not an artist’s rendering (Note: You must obtain express written permission from Apple before using any photograph owned or licensed by Apple).

c. The Apple product is shown only in the best light, in a manner or context that reflects favorably on the Apple products and on Apple Inc.

d. The reference to Apple does not create a sense of endorsement or sponsorship by, or other false association with, Apple or Apple products.

You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.
### <a name="_gmm567u8994r"></a>**Violation of These Terms of Use**
Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Apple’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple’s customers. Apple reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Apple deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Apple also may disclose your information when Apple determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Apple through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Apple determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Apple, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.

These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple may have at law or in equity.
